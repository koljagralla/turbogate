# Turbogate 

Turbogate is a micro framework and code generator aimed at building truly serverless, well validated, well documeted REST APIs using AWS CDK Typescript in turbo speed.

**V1.0.0 is completed, the only thing missing is some documentation here which will follow soon.**

<!-- # Installation
Turbogate has three runtime dependencies which you most probably will already have installed in a Typescript CDK project[^1].

```bash
yarn add aws-cdk-lib ts-node zod
```

Then install the main package:

```bash
yarn add koljagralla/turbogate
```


[^1]: In case something does not work properly, ensure that your installed versions have no breaking changes with the versions specified in the package.json. -->
